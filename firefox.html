    <h1>Firefox</h1>
    <p>Firefox is one of the amazing browsers, if you got a oportunity to use or test it, 
        give it a chance,<br> I would say for my own experience, that if you understand how to manage the Firefox,
        <br> you are going to have the better way to "surf the web" without to have problems with the RAM devour Chrome
